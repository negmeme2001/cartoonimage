# Cartoonify Image Using Open-CV
we will build one interesting application that will cartoonify the image provided to it. To build this cartoonifyer application we will use python and OpenCV. This is one of the exciting and thrilling applications of Machine Learning.
## Libraries
Python: We use python as a programming language for building the application.

cv2: We use cv2 for image processing.

Numpy: Mainly NumPy is used for dealing with arrays. Here the images that we use are stored in the form of arrays. So for that, we use NumPy.

easygui: easygui is a module used for GUI programming in python. In our application easygui is used to open the file box to upload images from the local system.

Imageio: Imageio is a python library that reads and writes the images.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is used for visualization purposes. Here we plot the images using matplotlib.

OS: Here in our application os is used for dealing with paths like reading images from the path and saving the image to the path.

Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Graphical User Interface(GUI) package.
## Usage 
When you run the application, this window will pop up with a button naming Catoonify your Image. Using this button you have to upload the image from your desktop.
